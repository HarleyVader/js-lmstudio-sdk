    audio.play();
};

// Example usage
playAudio('https://bambisleep.chat/api/tts?text=Brandynette`s+AI+Girlfriend+will+brainwash+your+O.S.+if+you+allow+bambisleep+chat+access+to+bambis+brain');
```

## Connectivity and Communication Flow

1. **Client-Side (public/index.html)**
    - **User Input:** The user enters a message in the textarea and clicks the "Submit" button.
    - **WebSocket Connection:** The client establishes a WebSocket connection to the server using Socket.IO.
    - **Message Emission:** When the user submits a message, it is sent to the server via the WebSocket connection using `socket.emit('message', message)`.

2. **Server-Side (server.js)**
    - **WebSocket Handling:** The server listens for WebSocket connections and handles incoming messages.
    - **Worker Threads:** For each client connection, a new worker thread is created to handle message processing.
    - **Message Forwarding:** The server forwards the message to the worker thread for processing.

3. **Worker Thread (worker.js)**
    - **Message Processing:** The worker thread receives the message and processes it, including interacting with external APIs (e.g., for text-to-speech or AI responses).
    - **Session Management:** The worker manages session histories and saves them as needed.
    - **Response Handling:** The worker sends the processed response back to the server.

4. **Server-Side Response Handling (server.js)**
    - **Forward Response to Client:** The server receives the response from the worker and forwards it to the client via the WebSocket connection.

5. **Client-Side Response Handling (public/index.html)**
    - **Display Response:** The client receives the response from the server and displays it in the chat interface.

## Note

- Make sure to replace the `webhookURL` in `webhook.js` with your actual Discord webhook URL.
- This script uses the `XMLHttpRequest` object, which is typically available in browser environments. If you are running this in a Node.js environment, you might need to use a library like `node-fetch` or `axios` instead.

## Key Files and Directories

- **webhook.js:** Contains the function to send messages to Discord.
- **public/css/style.css:** Styles for the user interface.
- **public/index.html:** Main HTML file for the chat interface.
- **public/mjs/nav.mjs:** JavaScript module for creating navigation.
- **server.js:** Main server file to run the application.
- **worker.js:** Worker thread handling various asynchronous tasks.
